JPEGdfs --- JPEG decoder from scratch.

1. What is JPEGdfs ?
   JPEGdfs is a JPEG decoder library which designed and implemented from
   scratch. Its purposes are all about to study the JPEG files' format and
   the details of the decode process. 

   There are many docs describe the JPEG standard or how to design a JPEG
   decoder. But most of them are only 'docs', not working programs. When 
   come to practise, it is still hard for the newbie to implement a JPEG 
   decoder. This is what JPEGdfs about, to implement a JPEG decoder from
   scratch.

   JPEGdfs is designed to be small, easy to hack.
   
   
2. What is NOT JPEGdfs ?
   JPEGdfs is not a library/decoder that intended to be used in the real
   world.

3. How to use JPEGdfs ?
   (Just read the code !)

4. About current version.
   -- It is the first working version.
   -- It can only decode baseline DCT with 3 component(Y,Cb,Cr) and a 
      4:2:0 subsampling JFIF file.
   -- But it's ready to hack.
